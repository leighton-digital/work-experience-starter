# Welcome to the Work Experience Starter Repo

This repo or repository (a centalised storage area for code) can be thought of a clean slate for you to build your application from.

We've installed some things to help you get moving quickly, but there are some things that you might want to have a look at before your start your time with Leighton.

## So whats in this repository?

### Next.js

Next.js can be thought of as the base on which your application will grow from. It'll allow you create pages and have routes between them.

Traditionally, when you visit a website, your computer sends a request to a server, which then creates and sends back a complete page. Next.js makes it easier and faster to do this by preparing parts of the website in advance. This means websites can load more quickly and work more smoothly, giving you a better experience when you browse online.

Next.js has many features built into it some of the features will most likely use are;

- Routing
- Rendering
- Data Fetching

The full docs can be found at <https://nextjs.org/docs>

### React

Next.js and React go together like peas and carrots.

React is a tool that helps developers build interactive parts of a website. In a traditional web setup, the server sends a whole new page every time something changes. With React, only the specific parts of the page that need updating are changed. This means websites can respond more quickly and feel smoother to use, much like refreshing just a section of a picture rather than the whole image.

React has many concepts to understand, but these core principals are a great place to start

#### Components

Think of these as the building blocks of a website. Each component is like a small, reusable piece of the interface.

#### JSX

This is a special way of writing components. It looks a bit like HTML, making it easier to understand how your website is structured.

#### Props

Short for properties, these allow you to pass information from one component to another, much like giving instructions to a specific part.

#### State

This is how components keep track of changing data. It lets the website update parts of itself without reloading the whole page.

#### Event Handling

This covers how your website reacts when someone interacts with it (for example, clicking a button).

The [React Documentation](https://react.dev/) is agreat place to understand React just looking at the code snippets in [the describing the ui section](https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)

### Radix-UI and Tailwind

**Radix UI** is a collection of ready-made, unstyled building blocks for website components. It provides basic interactive elements—like menus, modals, or tooltips—that work well out of the box and are designed with accessibility in mind. Developers can then style these components to match their website's look, making it easier to create interactive features that everyone can use.

More info can be found at the [Radix-UI Primitives docs page](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives)

**Tailwind CSS** is a styling tool that helps developers design websites quickly. It offers a set of small, reusable classes that you can mix and match to apply specific styles (such as colours, margins, or text sizes) directly in your HTML. This approach makes it simpler to create a consistent and attractive design without writing a lot of custom CSS.

More infor on Tailwind can be found at the [Tailwind CSS site](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Radix UI and Tailwind CSS make a strong pair for building user interfaces. Radix UI provides a range of functional, accessible components—such as modals, tooltips, or dropdowns—ensuring the interactive parts of your website work well for everyone. Tailwind CSS, meanwhile, offers a flexible set of styling classes that let you customise these components quickly and consistently.

When used together, you can focus on creating a seamless, user-friendly experience with Radix UI, while Tailwind CSS helps you shape the visual design to match your brand or style. This combination allows you to build interfaces that are both highly functional and visually appealing without extra hassle.
